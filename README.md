# Gan Face Generator
In this project, It'll be defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible.

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. That project aims to build a model that must be able to create samples that should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.



DATA SET
--------

You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks.

Some samples:

Install
--------

It is suggested to use virtualenv (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

Then use pip to install the requirement:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

This project is just for your reference and fun purposes. Additionally, I share it as a portfolio of my work.
